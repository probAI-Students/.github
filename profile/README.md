# probAI-Students-Research-Work

Welcome to the **probAI-Students-Research-Work** GitHub organization! This is the central hub for hosting and showcasing the research work of students from the ProbAI research group at NSSlab, ITMO University.

## üéì Mission

Our mission is to provide students with a platform where they can collaborate, share, and present their work on various research topics in the realm of probabilistic artificial intelligence.

## üìö Repository Structure

Each repository within this organization is dedicated to a specific research topic or project. This modular approach ensures that each student's work is well-organized and easily accessible.

### Repository Naming Convention

To maintain a uniform structure, repositories are named based on the research topic or the main theme they represent. For example:

- `probabilistic-graph-models`
- `bayesian-inference-techniques`
- `neural-variational-methods`
- `bayesian-networks-structure-learning`

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Explore Existing Projects**: Browse through the repositories to get a feel for the diverse research topics our students are working on.
2. **Contribute**: If you're a student member of the ProbAI research group and want to contribute, reach out to the organization's admins for guidance on setting up your own repository.
3. **Feedback and Collaboration**: We encourage open collaboration. If you have suggestions, feedback, or want to collaborate on a project, feel free to open an issue in the respective repository or contact the repository maintainers.
